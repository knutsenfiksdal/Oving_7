This is my solution to the problem stated in "oving 7 testing"

## Project structure

For this task I have created the test file ```tests.py``` which will attempt to verify the file ```tur.py```. The file ```tur.py``` should comply with the following requrements:

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
